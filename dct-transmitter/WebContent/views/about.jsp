Image compression is important for many applications that involve huge data storage, transmission and retrieval such as for multimedia, documents, video conferencing, and medical imaging. Uncompressed images require considerable storage capacity and transmission bandwidth. The objective of image compression technique is to reduce redundancy of the image data in order to be able to store or transmit data in an efficient form. This results in the reduction of file size and allows more images to be stored in a given amount of disk or memory space .Image compression can be lossy or lossless . In a lossless compression algorithm, compressed data can be used to recreate an exact replica of the original.</p>
